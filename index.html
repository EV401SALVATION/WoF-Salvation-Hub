        <p>Wings of Fire: Salvation is a large-scale fanfiction project based on the Wings of Fire series that I have been working on for quite some time. It focuses on a rag-tag group of characters and their many adventures across the Wings of Fire multiverse.</p>
        <p>On this site you'll be able to find:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Links to each of the different volumes of the story.</li>
            <li>Information about the characters and worlds.</li>
            <li>Tie-in games based on the story.</li>
            <li>Papercraft based on the story.</li>
